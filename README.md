# NavaticsMito-Rev

**NOTE**: This is not finished yet, do not expect active development :(

A Jadx project for reversing Navatics Mito app, to perhaps get it working without unreachable Navatics servers ...

You need to manually download a copy of `Navatics_0.4.0_APKPure.apk` in the `reversing` folder of the repo.

# Structure

* `reversing` folder contains Jadx project of reversed Navatics Mito app
* `patch` contains LSPosed patch app to patch the original apk
